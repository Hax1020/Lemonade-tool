congratulation! you just terminated a server by sending too many datas!

##DDoS:
but there is a problem!
because they know who raided their servers and they will find you and they will block your ip and will get you by police!
so what can we do right now?

the answer is easy using multiple ip or devices to raiding a server or ip!
let me show you

as you see you can hide yourslef between many other ip raiding a server at the same time also attack will be powerful and faster!

also they will not be able to find this attack's master mind quike! but they will find you but hard!
